          Detected user input used to manually construct a SQL string. This is usually bad practice  
          because manual construction could accidentally result in a SQL injection. An attacker could
          use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a            
          parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, 
          consider using an object-relational mapper (ORM) such as Sequelize which will protect your 
          queries.
